# Setting-Up-a-School-Proxy
A school proxy acts as an intermediary between your device and the websites you wish to access. Instead of connecting directly to the website, the proxy handles the connection on your behalf. It retrieves the webpage, downloads it, and then forwards it to you. This means that the website only sees the IP address of the proxy, not your own. Essentially, your interaction with websites is mediated by the proxy, making it appear to internet filters that your activity is confined to the proxy server, thereby obscuring your access to the actual website.

## Methods of Unblocking Websites at School

### Approach 1: Utilize a School Proxy
One of the simplest methods to unblock websites is by using a [school proxy](https://www.okeyproxy.com/proxy/unblocking-websites-for-school-proxy-2024/). Proxies hide your IP address and reroute your internet traffic through various public servers. Many proxies are designed to work with specific apps or browsers, making them user-friendly.

### Approach 2: Employ a VPN
Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) routes your connection through a remote server, which then connects you to the website. This hides your actual IP address and allows you to bypass restrictions. If you experience a slowdown in performance, there are techniques to boost your speed.

### Approach 3: Leverage Google’s Cache
Google maintains local copies of websites to speed up loading times, known as caching. If you’re blocked from accessing the original site, you might still be able to access its cached version.

### Approach 4: Unblock Websites Using Chrome Extensions
There are numerous browser extension proxies tailored for widely used browsers. These extensions function similarly to proxy websites but are integrated directly into your browser, eliminating the need to visit an actual proxy website to unblock content.
